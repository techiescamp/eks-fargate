- **Fluent Bit**: Log forwarding and processing
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Metrics collection and visualization
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for microservices
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: End-to-end observability

#### 🚪 Ingress & Traffic Management
- **AWS Load Balancer Controller**: Advanced ingress configurations
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Certificate management with ACM
- **Path-based Routing**: Multiple services behind single endpoint
